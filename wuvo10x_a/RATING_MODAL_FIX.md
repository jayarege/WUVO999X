# Rating Modal Button Positioning Fix

## Issue Description
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Assignee:** Developer  
**Labels:** UI/UX, Bug Fix, Rating System  

### Problem
The rating buttons (Love, Like, Average, Disliked) in the rating modal are appearing outside the modal bounds, making them inaccessible to users.

### Root Cause
1. Modal content height constraints were too restrictive (70% max height)
2. Fixed button container positioning was not properly anchored within modal
3. Padding calculations didn't account for button container space

### Solution Implemented

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/Styles/modalStyles.js`**
   - Increased modal `maxHeight` from 70% to 75%
   - Added `minHeight: 400` to ensure adequate space
   - Adjusted `top` and `bottom` positioning

2. **`src/Styles/ratingStyles.js`**
   - Fixed `fixedButtonsContainer` positioning with `position: 'absolute'`
   - Anchored buttons to bottom of modal with `bottom: 0`
   - Added proper border radius for rounded corners

3. **`src/Components/RatingModal.js`**
   - Added `paddingBottom: 80` to content container to prevent overlap
   - Modified LinearGradient layout to use `position: 'relative'`

4. **`src/Components/EnhancedRatingSystem.js`**
   - Reduced sentiment button padding from 20 to 16
   - Added `maxHeight: '80%'` to sentiment modal
   - Optimized button spacing and layout

### Testing Checklist

### Technical Details
